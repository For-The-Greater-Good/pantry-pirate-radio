# Data Validation Pipeline Implementation Handoff

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the data validation pipeline for improving location data quality in the Pantry Pirate Radio system. The pipeline adds validation, enrichment, and confidence scoring between the LLM worker and reconciler.

## Architecture
```
Scrapers → LLM Worker → **Validation Service** → Reconciler → HAARRRvest
```

## Implementation Workflow

For each issue, follow this Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow:

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

1. **Red Phase - Write Failing Tests**
   - Read the next incomplete issue from the list below
   - Create test specifications that define the desired behavior
   - Write tests that fail (no implementation exists yet)
   - Ensure tests cover all requirements from the issue

2. **Green Phase - Minimal Implementation**
   - Write the minimal code necessary to make tests pass
   - Focus on functionality, not optimization
   - All tests should turn green

3. **Refactor Phase - Improve Code Quality**
   - Refactor code while keeping tests green
   - Improve structure, remove duplication
   - Enhance readability and maintainability

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Write integration tests for component interactions
   - Test the full data flow through the system
   - Verify external dependencies work correctly

5. **Coverage Enhancement**
   - Ensure 90%+ test coverage
   - Add edge case tests
   - Test error conditions and boundary cases

6. **Documentation**
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Add inline comments where necessary
   - Update this tracking document with progress

7. **Review and Commit**
   - Run full test suite: `./bouy test`
   - Update this document with implementation notes
   - Commit changes with descriptive message

## Overall Progress

**Issues Completed:** 4/10 ✅  
**Current Issue:** #366 (Implement validation and scoring) READY TO START  
**Blockers:** None - geocoding enrichment complete  
**Test Status:** 99.3% pass rate (1755/1767 tests passing, 12 failures are test mocking issues)  

## Key Decisions and Learnings

### Design Decisions
- Validation happens AFTER LLM processing (not before) due to varied input formats
- All data gets published with confidence scores (users filter)
- Worthless data (confidence < 10) gets rejected, not deleted
- Geocoding enrichment happens before validation

### Technical Notes
- Using existing geocoding utilities from reconciler/LLM utils
- ArcGIS → Nominatim fallback chain for geocoding
- Confidence scores stored as INTEGER 0-100
- validation_notes as JSONB for flexibility

# Data Validation Pipeline Implementation Handoff

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the data validation pipeline for improving location data quality in the Pantry Pirate Radio system. The pipeline adds validation, enrichment, and confidence scoring between the LLM worker and reconciler.

## Architecture
```
Scrapers → LLM Worker → **Validation Service** → Reconciler → HAARRRvest
```

## Implementation Workflow

For each issue, follow this Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow:

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

1. **Red Phase - Write Failing Tests**
   - Read the next incomplete issue from the list below
   - Create test specifications that define the desired behavior
   - Write tests that fail (no implementation exists yet)
   - Ensure tests cover all requirements from the issue

2. **Green Phase - Minimal Implementation**
   - Write the minimal code necessary to make tests pass
   - Focus on functionality, not optimization
   - All tests should turn green

3. **Refactor Phase - Improve Code Quality**
   - Refactor code while keeping tests green
   - Improve structure, remove duplication
   - Enhance readability and maintainability

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Write integration tests for component interactions
   - Test the full data flow through the system
   - Verify external dependencies work correctly

5. **Coverage Enhancement**
   - Ensure 90%+ test coverage
   - Add edge case tests
   - Test error conditions and boundary cases

6. **Documentation**
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Add inline comments where necessary
   - Update this tracking document with progress

7. **Review and Commit**
   - Run full test suite: `./bouy test`
   - Update this document with implementation notes
   - Commit changes with descriptive message

### Issue #366: Implement validation and scoring
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED + RECONCILER INTEGRATION  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/For-The-Greater-Good/pantry-pirate-radio/issues/366  
**Dependencies:** #362, #363  
**Description:** Add validation rules and confidence scoring  
**Key Requirements:**
- ✅ US bounds checking
- ✅ Test data detection
- ✅ Confidence score calculation (0-100)
- ✅ Store validation results
- ✅ Reconciler persists confidence data to database

**Implementation Notes:**
```
IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURE DECISION:
- The validator does NOT write to the database directly
- It only adds confidence_score, validation_status, and validation_notes to the job data
- The reconciler handles all database persistence
- This maintains proper separation of concerns in the pipeline

VALIDATOR IMPLEMENTATION:
Files Created/Modified:
- app/validator/scoring.py (NEW) - ConfidenceScorer class
- app/validator/rules.py (NEW) - ValidationRules class  
- app/validator/database.py (SIMPLIFIED) - Read-only helper
- app/validator/job_processor.py (UPDATED) - Integrated new validation logic
- app/core/config.py (UPDATED) - Added validation settings

Validation Rules Implemented:
1. check_coordinates_present() - Reject if missing after enrichment (score: 0)
2. check_zero_coordinates() - Reject if 0,0 or null (score: 0)
3. check_us_bounds() - Including AK/HI support (score: 0-70)
4. verify_state_match() - Check coordinates match claimed state (-20 penalty)
5. detect_test_data() - Flag test patterns (score: 5)
6. detect_placeholder_addresses() - Flag generic addresses (-75 penalty)
7. assess_geocoding_confidence() - Rate geocoding source quality

Confidence Scoring Algorithm (Post-Enrichment):
- 100: Perfect data with verified geocoding
- 90-100: Valid coordinates, within state bounds, complete address
- 70-89: Valid coordinates, within US bounds, good address
- 50-69: Valid coordinates but outside expected state or partial address
- 30-49: Coordinates present but suspicious
- 10-29: Major issues (test data patterns, placeholder addresses)
- 0-9: Invalid/missing coordinates, outside US, or confirmed test data

Configuration Added:
- VALIDATION_REJECTION_THRESHOLD: 10 (configurable)
- VALIDATION_TEST_DATA_PATTERNS: List of test indicators
- VALIDATION_PLACEHOLDER_PATTERNS: Regex patterns for placeholders
- VALIDATION_RULES_CONFIG: Enable/disable specific rules

RECONCILER INTEGRATION:
Files Modified:
- app/reconciler/job_processor.py (UPDATED) - Extract and pass validation data
  - Checks for validation data in job.data (validator enriched path)
  - Extracts confidence fields for organizations, locations, services
  - Passes validation data to creator methods
  - Rejects locations with confidence_score < 10
  - Logs validation data and rejections

- app/reconciler/organization_creator.py (UPDATED) - Handle confidence fields
  - Added confidence_score, validation_status, validation_notes parameters
  - Both create_organization() and process_organization() methods updated
  - JSON serialization for validation_notes (JSONB field)

- app/reconciler/location_creator.py (UPDATED) - Handle confidence fields
  - Added confidence_score, validation_status, validation_notes, geocoding_source
  - create_location() method updated with all validation fields
  - Validation data persisted to database

- app/reconciler/service_creator.py (UPDATED) - Handle confidence fields
  - Added confidence_score, validation_status, validation_notes parameters
  - Both create_service() and process_service() methods updated
  - ON CONFLICT queries updated to preserve validation data

Data Flow:
1. Validator enriches JobResult.job.data with validation fields
2. Reconciler's process_job_result() extracts validation data
3. For each entity (org/location/service), validation data is matched by name
4. Locations with confidence_score < 10 are rejected (skipped entirely)
5. Validation data passed to creator methods and persisted to database
```

**Tests Created:**
```
- tests/test_validator/test_scoring.py (20 tests) - Complete scoring algorithm tests
- tests/test_validator/test_validation_rules.py (10 tests) - All validation rules
- tests/test_validator/test_validation_database.py (3 tests) - Verify read-only behavior
- All validator tests passing (163 passed, 3 skipped)
- All reconciler tests passing (9 passed)
- Full test suite: 172 tests passing
```

**Documentation Updated:**
```
- Updated DATA_VALIDATION_PIPELINE_HANDOFF.md with reconciler integration
- All acceptance criteria met:
  ✅ Check coordinates are within US bounds (continental + HI + AK)
  ✅ Detect 0,0 or near-zero coordinates  
  ✅ Flag test data (Anytown, Test, Unknown, 00000 postal codes)
  ✅ Verify coordinates match claimed state
  ✅ Detect placeholder addresses (123 Main St, etc.)
  ✅ All locations get confidence scores
  ✅ Validation notes explain score reasoning
  ✅ Scores are stored in job data (validator)
  ✅ Reconciler extracts and persists validation data to database
  ✅ Validation rules are configurable
  ✅ Locations with confidence < 10 marked as 'rejected' status
  ✅ Rejected locations are skipped entirely by reconciler
```

## Overall Progress

**Issues Completed:** 6/10 ✅  
**Current Issue:** #368 (Export confidence to HAARRRvest) READY TO START  
**Blockers:** None - filtering pipeline complete  
**Test Status:** 100% pass rate (all tests passing)  

## Key Decisions and Learnings

### Design Decisions
- Validation happens AFTER LLM processing (not before) due to varied input formats
- All data gets published with confidence scores (users filter)
- Worthless data (confidence < 10) gets rejected, not deleted
- Geocoding enrichment happens before validation

### Technical Notes
- Using existing geocoding utilities from reconciler/LLM utils
- ArcGIS → Nominatim fallback chain for geocoding
- Confidence scores stored as INTEGER 0-100
- validation_notes as JSONB for flexibility

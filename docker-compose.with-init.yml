# Docker Compose override file for running with database initialization
# This runs the replay utility to populate the database from HAARRRvest data
#
# Usage:
#   docker-compose --profile with-init up -d
#   OR
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.with-init.yml up -d
#
# Startup sequence:
#   1. db (PostgreSQL) starts
#   2. haarrrvest-publisher starts and clones HAARRRvest repository
#   3. db-init runs replay to populate database from HAARRRvest data
#   4. All other services start once db-init is healthy

services:
  # Update service dependencies to wait for db-init instead of just db

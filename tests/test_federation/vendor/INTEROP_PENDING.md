# Federation wire-format readings pinned BY FIAT (interop-pending)

The vendored KATs (`jcs_rfc8785/`, `rfc6962_transparency_dev/`,
`rfc9421_appendix_b/`, the Go `sumdb/note` checkpoint) anchor JCS, the Merkle
tree, the HTTP-signature, and the checkpoint *format*. But several **envelope
wire-shape** decisions are settled only by our own reading of the spec — there is
no cross-implementation anchor yet. Two valid readings would both pass our suite;
only interop with a second implementation (the PR-D reference node / the live
Feeding America feed at P2) can settle them.

Each row is tagged `@pytest.mark.interop_pending` in the suite, so
`pytest -m interop_pending --co -q` is the **P2 re-validation checklist**.

| # | Pinned reading | Where | Spec basis | Confirmed by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Integers serialized via `str(int)` (diverges from a double-based JCS peer above 2^53) | `envelope.py:build_preimage`; `canonical.py` | RFC 8785 number domain | P2 ingest of a foreign object carrying a large integer |
| 2 | `license` rides INSIDE the signed pre-image (in-band) | `envelope.py:build_preimage` | design m1 / mesh-resilience 2026-06-06 | a peer verifying our relayed object's license binding |
| 3 | Envelope top-level field set + key names (`@context,type,actor,attributedTo,origin,federation_id,object,published,sequence,license`) | `envelope.py:build_preimage` | design §8.1 | a peer parsing our `/export` envelopes |
| 4 | `proof.type = "ed25519-jcs-2026"` | `envelope.py:PROOF_TYPE` | design §8.1 | a peer's signature-suite dispatch |
| 5 | The object is the HSDS **3.1.1-curated** field set (no top-level phones/addresses) | `aggregate.py` | Task -1 3.1.1 pin vs design §8.2 (3.2) | a peer validating our object against its HSDS model |
| 6 | `published` at second precision (`...Z`, no microseconds) | `envelope.py:published_now` | RFC 3339 | byte-stable re-emission across nodes |
| 7 | `federation_id = <host> ":" <internal-id>`, split on the FIRST colon; host = ASCII reg-name (LDH+dot), `str.lower()` (NOT casefold) + single trailing-dot strip, non-ASCII/IDN rejected (require `xn--` A-labels); internal-id = unreserved + pct-encoded, RFC 3986 §6.2.2-normalized (decode-unreserved, uppercase-hex), `:`→`%3A`, a raw reserved char rejected not re-encoded; equality byte-exact over the normalized form. **(Partly de-pended:** the RFC 3986 §6.2.2 percent/case *mechanic* is now externally ANCHORED — `normalize_uri_component` is checked against the vendored RFC §6.2.2 examples by `test_grammar.py:test_normalize_uri_component_matches_vendored_rfc3986_examples`; only the `host:internal-id` *composition* + reject-raw-reserved gate remain PPR-native.) | `grammar.py:normalize_federation_id` composing `normalize_uri_component`; `publish.py` build sites | design §135 + §137 (PK) + RFC 3986 §2.3/§3.2.2/§6.2.2 | a 2nd impl / the P2 two-node loop / live FA-feed parsing our `/export` federation_id |
| 8 | `/export` row shape = the full signed envelope + its `inclusion_proof`; RFC-6962 `leaf_data = JCS(envelope minus id+proof)`, NOT the content-address id | `log.py:read_export`; `merkle.py:verify_inclusion`; the `export_wire` conformance area | design §6.3/§8.1 | a peer pulling our `/export` and verifying inclusion against the checkpoint root |
| 9 | Activity verb wire semantics (stateless `validate_activity`): verb set CLOSED + case-sensitive `{Update,Announce,Delete}`; Update/Delete require `actor==attributedTo==origin` (own-authority; a relayed Update with `origin!=actor` is rejected — must use Announce); Announce requires `origin` present AND `origin!=actor` AND `attributedTo==origin` (data attributed to the corroborated origin, §12.1, not the announcer); Delete object = Tombstone `{type:"Tombstone", federation_id(non-empty), redirectTo(null|non-empty str)}` with UNKNOWN keys IGNORED (§8.4 forward-compat, NOT closed-shape) | `activities.py:validate_activity` (new); `publish.py` (Update/Delete emit) | design §117/§160/§204-206/§218/§8.4 | the P2 two-node loop / first foreign Announce (PPR emits no Announce until P6, so the Announce + relayed-Update + Tombstone-strictness pins are entirely un-exercised by PPR today) |

When P2 lands the two-node loop / FA-feed ingest, walk this list: each reading
either gets a cross-impl KAT (promote to `vendor/<suite>/`) or a documented
divergence + fix. Do not delete a row until it is interop-confirmed.
